MITRC practices out of MIT's Pierce Boathouse, Building W8, located on campus at 409 Memorial Drive, Cambridge MA 02139.
The "MITRC Drawer" (for waiver submissions, dues, etc) is located on the lower level, near the cox boxes. It is clearly labeled "MITRC."

## SAFETY VIDEO
All MITRC members are encouraged to watch the US Rowing safety video.

## DOCK PREPARATION & BOATHOUSE PROTOCOLS
Before we get on the water, we need to get on the dock, and in order to get on the dock, the dock needs to be prepared. This often involves removing large quantities of goose poop. As guests of the boathouse, we must ensure that we follow the procedural protocols set forth by the management to maintain the tidiness of the boathouse and facilitate the orderly operation of the various groups using it. The Boathouse Protocols Page provides an overview of these procedures, and all MITRC members should familiarize themselves with them early in the season. If you have any questions or if anything is unsure, simply ask a veteran club member. 

## WHAT TO WEAR
