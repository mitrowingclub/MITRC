## Welcome to the MIT rowing club's website.

### MITRC TLDR

MITRC is a community-run, co-ed rowing club open to MIT affiliates. Thrice a year, we offer programs ranging from total beginners (aka Learn To Row, aka LTR), to novices, to recreational and competitive rowers.  Our members participate in several regattas throughout the year, including the Head of the Charles.

*NB*: MITRC is `not the same` as MIT varsity rowing (aka MIT crew). If you are a prospective undegrad interested in rowing while at MIT, you should be looking at the varsity rowing website [here](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-crewlt/index).
