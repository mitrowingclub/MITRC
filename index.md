# Welcome to the MIT rowing club website!

*Fall season 2018 started September 4, and is oversubscribed.* If you want to cox, coach or sub, then feel free to get in touch. Otherwise, stay tuned for future seasons by subscribing to our [mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitrc).

### MITRC TLDR

MITRC is a community-run, co-ed rowing club open to MIT affiliates. Thrice a year, we offer programs ranging from total beginners (aka Learn To Row, aka LTR), to novices, to recreational and competitive rowers.  Our members participate in several regattas throughout the year, including the Head of the Charles.

*NB*: MITRC is _not the same_ as MIT varsity rowing (aka MIT crew). If you are a prospective undegrad interested in rowing while at MIT, you should be looking at the varsity rowing website [here](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-crewlt/index).
