# Welcome to the MIT rowing club website!

*Fall season 2018 started September 4, and is oversubscribed.* If you want to cox, coach or sub, then feel free to get in touch. Otherwise, stay tuned for future seasons by subscribing to our [mitrc mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitrc).

### MITRC at a glance

MITRC is a community-run, co-ed rowing club open to MIT affiliates. Thrice a year, we offer programs ranging from total beginners (aka Learn To Row, aka LTR), to novices, to recreational and competitive rowers.  Our members participate in several regattas throughout the year, including the Head of the Charles.

*NB*: MITRC is _not the same_ as the [MIT varsity crew](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-crewlt/index). If you are a prospective undegrad athlete interested in rowing while at MIT, you should be contacting them.

Join our [mitrc mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitrc) to keep up with important announcements, including signup sheets for future seasons.

### Joining MITRC

### Donating to MITRC

Rowing is an expensive sport--no question about it. The grants MITRC receives from MIT/DAPER do not fully cover the cost of running the club, so we charge dues. But MITRC takes great pride in being open and accessible to all MIT affiliates, regardless of experience level or financial resources. If you would like to help us provide accessible rowing opportunities for the entire MIT community, you can do so with a donation. 

Donations can be made through our our [giving.mit.edu donation page](https://giving.mit.edu/give/to?fundId=2437100).

You gift will help us:
-Offset participation costs
-Keep our rowing equipment functional
-Participate in regattas
-Establish a long-term fund to provide increased financial stability

_Thank You for your Support!_
