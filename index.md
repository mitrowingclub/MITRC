# About MITRC

_MITRC is a community-run, co-ed rowing club open to MIT affiliates.  Our club aims to develop new rowers and to let people in the MIT community enjoy the sport of rowing._

For three seasons every year, we offer rowing practices for people at all levels of experience and of all ages: ranging from complete beginners (aka Learn To Row, aka LTR) to competitive rowers. Our members' ages range from 20 to 70+ years old, and their affiliations to MIT run the gamut from students, to staff, to faculty, to alumni. Our members participate in several regattas throughout the year, including the Head of the Charles.

MITRC is _not_ the same as the more competitive [MIT varsity crew](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-crewlt/index). If you are a (prospective) undegrad athlete interested in rowing while at MIT, you should be in touch with them.

Join our [mitrc mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitrc) to keep up with important announcements, including signup sheets for future seasons.

# Donating to MITRC

Rowing is an expensive sport--no question about it. The grants MITRC receives from MIT/DAPER do not fully cover the cost of running the club, so we charge dues. But MITRC takes great pride in being open and accessible to all MIT affiliates, regardless of experience level or financial resources. In fact, our rowers come from all walks of life and many different cultures.

If you would like to help us provide accessible rowing opportunities for the entire MIT community, you can do so with a donation at our [giving.mit.edu donation page](https://giving.mit.edu/give/to?fundId=2437100).

You gift will help us:<br>
-Offset participation costs<br>
-Keep our rowing equipment functional<br>
-Participate in regattas<br>
-Establish a long-term fund to provide increased financial stability<br>

_Thank You for your Support!_

# Coaches

_John Cotter_ originally hails from Buffalo, New York, but has lived in Boston since the early 2000s. He rowed at (and graduated from) the University of Washington and continues to row competitively as a member of the Narragansett Boat Club, the oldest rowing club in America. John has long been credited as the architect of what is known as the modern stroke*. An MITRC coach since 2012, he greatly enjoys the rowers, the rowing and being able to be a small part of the MIT experience.

_Glenn Beauchemin_ is originally from Rhode Island and moved to the Boston area in the late 1970s where, finally at the age of thirty-seven, he discovered rowing. Within a couple of years, while on the Men’s Comp team at Community Rowing, he began coaching and eventually found his way to MITRC. Glenn has been coaching at MITRC since 2009. He especially enjoys the club’s friendly, upbeat attitude as well as the eagerness of the rowers to learn. Glenn is not really familiar with the “modern rowing stroke,” but whatever it is, he’s quite confident that his current stroke is vastly superior.*

_André Bastos_ is originally from Brazil, and immigrated to the US with his family when he was 5. He grew up in California and North Carolina and attended the University of California at Berkeley, where his love for the sport of rowing began when he walked on to the crew program as a freshman. André rowed for the Cal Berkeley Bears under legendary coaches Geoff Bond and Steve Gladstone from 2003-2007, a time during which the Bears won multiple national IRA championships. The experience was powerful, as the daily practice of rowing required a quiet intensity, a steady passion, and a level of commitment and dedication that is rarely called for in today's world. These life lessons from rowing continue to provide him with the motivation to teach the sport to others. André received his PhD in neuroscience from UC Davis in 2013 and moved to the Boston area in 2014 to begin his postdoctoral training at MIT. Since the Fall of 2015, he has been coaching at MITRC where he enjoys introducing the beautiful sport of rowing to newcomers from all walks of life and backgrounds.  

_Christine Chirch-Cassidy_ hails from Chicago where she started rowing as a freshman at Kenwood Academy High School, eventually completing her senior year of competition with Chicago Rowing Foundation (Formerly Lincoln Park Juniors).  She attended Purdue University where she competed for four years in the Women’s Varsity 8+ and served as the Club President from 2003 – 2004.  Returning to Chicago after graduation, Christine pursued a coaching position with Chicago Rowing Foundation and in the 9 years with the club she coached the High School Women’s novice 8+, the Juniors Women’s 8+, and the Women’s Lightweight 8+ (which qualified for Nationals).  For her last three years in Chicago, Christine coached Adult Recreational crews, Learn-to-row programs, and grew a program designed for Athletes on the Autism spectrum to gain access to the sport.  Christine specifically loves working on catch positioning and timing to ensure a successful use of power throughout the stroke. Christine moved to Boston in January 2015 and is eager to get out on the water with the MIT crews!

# FAQ

#### I'm new. What do I wear for practice tomorrow?

If you are new to the club or to Boston weather, know that conditions on the water often are 10 degrees cooler, and the wind is frequently stronger than on land.  Additionally, you will get wet from perspiration, splash or rain. 

Here's a checklist to help you gear up appropriately:

1. Hats, sunglasses and sunscreen. 
1. Socks. The rowing shoes are attached to the boat, so you share them with many people.
1. Form fitting clothes. Loose shorts get caught in the slides under the moving seats. Avoid basketball style shorts, sweatpants, or warm-ups.  Loose tops can get caught in the oar handles, so avoid bulky jackets or sweatshirts. Prefer spandex shorts/trousers for wearing in the boat. 
1. For colder days: layers. A base layer (eg, running or workout t-shirts or tanks, fabrics such as Polypropylene and Capilene), an insulating layer (eg synthetic fleece jacket), and a wind block layer (eg. a wind breaker).
1. Avoid cotton and down.

#### Can I buy MITRC gear?

Yes. MITRC's _classic_ striped uniforms as well as splash-jackets, shirts, tank-tops, hats, and other MITRC-branded gear are available for purchase multiple times a year. An e-mail announcement will be sent to all members in advance of each gear order.

#### I've been assigned to cox. Help?
We rely on all members to cox the boats. Relax, and let MITRC's former head cox Tom Law guide you to success.

_Make sure to bring sunglasses and warm clothes_.

More coxing materials are available in our [How to cox](how_to_cox.md) page, check them out!

#### Can I read more things?
Not asked that frequently. But check out our [Boathouse protocols](boathouse_protocols.md) page.
