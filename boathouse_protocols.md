## Boathouse protocols

### BIKE PARKING
Bicycles can be locked to the green fence along the embankment in front of the boathouse, but be sure to keep the gate in the fence clear at all times. The gate is somewhat disguised and is located to the right of the entrance stairs as you face the boathouse. The gate is frequently used to maneuver boats and equipment in/out of the boathouse. Bikes parked in this vicinity will have their locks cut.

### AUTOMOBILE PARKING
Parking is generally available along Memorial Drive at 6:00 a.m. Note that parking in the driveway in front of the boathouse is not permitted for MITRC members as the driveway is frequently used for trailers and other boathouse operations. Metered parking is free of charge until 8:00 a.m.

### ARRIVAL ON THE DOCK
As the first crew out each morning, it usually falls to MITRC to prepare the dock for the day's activities. There are a number of tasks that need to get done before boats can be taken out on the water. These include taking out the oars, taking down the goose lines, sweeping the docks, and/or removing the sprinklers. These last tasks are essential to clearing the dock of goose poop. Additionally in some cases the dock will need to be hosed down to adequately remove the goose poop. (Sometimes there's a really large quantity of poop). Upon arrival, see what needs to be done and help out. If you aren't sure what to do or how to do it, ask a veteran club member. Preparing the dock for the day's practice is a necessity of rowing, and all club members are expected to pitch in.

### OARS
MITRC's oars are located in the far bay and are (mostly) painted with the MIT block logo (some oars are unpainted and others feature the old Sloan Crew logo, an homage to MITRC's former incarnation). Do not use any other oars in the boathouse, unless you've been given permission to do so. At present MITRC has a number of complete sets of (eight) oars in addition to a few incomplete sets. Sets of oars are often distinguished by matching colored tape on the shaft of the oar (see image at right). These include the Blue/Yellow (a.k.a. Boston Strong) set, the Pink/Purple (a.k.a. Dunkin Donuts) set, the Red/White set, etc. Additionally some sets are distinguished by another common characteristic (e.g. wooden handles). Pay close attention to the distinguishing feature of each set and keep the oars of the same set together at all times:
When taking out the oars, group the oars by set on the edge of the dock, so that each set of oars is clearly identifiable. When placing oars on the dock, let the blade of the oar hang off the edge of the dock so as o avoid scratching the blade.
When storing the oars, make sure each full set is stored together in the same bay. Avoid mixing oars from different sets. To maximize space and reduce scratching the oars, store the oars efficiently with blades all facing in the same direction--and if you're really OCD alternating starboard/portside (see image at far right).

### TAKING DOWN GOOSE LINES

Each dock is equipped with a cord that runs along the perimeter edge, fixed to the dock by stakes, in an attempt to deter geese from mounting thedock. The efficacy of 
this system is the subject of much debate. Nonetheless beforeputting a boat into the water (and getting riggers entangled with t
hese cords), the goose lines need to be taken down. Taking goose lines down is exceedingly simple and comprises of two steps: 
Step 1: Pull the stake up out of its hole (see image at right).
Step 2: Place the stake on the dock in the same vicinity (see image at far right).
Repeat this sequence of steps for each stake around the perimeter of the dock. Just remember:
Don't untie the cords from the stakes.
Don't remove the goose lines from the dock.
Don't bundle, fold, or tangle the goose lines.
Just follow steps 1 and 2 above.

### SWEEPING THE DOCK
In the likely event that the goose lines were not sufficient in deterring the geese and their resultant poop, additional measures must be taken. One such measure is sweeping the dock. Although this sounds simple enough, please make note of the following:
Be sure to use the correct broom for this task. Use the large brooms (see image at right). These brooms are located on the dock and are stored along the exterior wall of the boathouse.
Be sure not to use the incorrect broom for this task. Do not use the smaller brooms (see image at far right). These are intended for boat cleaning.
At present we are fortunate to benefit from the recent acquisition of a set of new large brooms so that many people can sweep the dock at the same time. Once you've completed sweeping, return the broom where you found it.
In some cases, the goose poop may be too wet to sweep effectively. In this case you may use a shovel to scoop the poop off the dock. Shovels are located in the same vicinity as the large brooms and should also be returned to their place after use.

### SPRINKLERS & HOSES
One additional--and more effective--tool in the arsenal to combat goose poop is the use of motion-sensitive sprinklers. These are affixed to each dock and, like the goose lines, must be removed before the dock can be used. Removing sprinklers is more complex than taking down goose lines, and the following steps must be followed precisely:

Step 1: Turn off the faucet
The main faucet that feeds the sprinklers on the dock is located on the exterior wall of the boathouse, between the first and second bays. Be sure to turn off the water supply completely before moving on to the next steps. Don't turn off any of the other faucets (including those at the hose junction). Only the main faucet should be turned off.

Step 2: Turn off the sprinklers
Turn off each sprinkler by rotating the knob on the back of the device counterclockwise to the off position (see image at right). Note that although the water supply to the sprinkler may already have been turned off, residual water may still emerge from the device, sometimes with surprising force. For this reason, always keep the sprinkler pointed away from you as you turn it off and move on to the next steps.

Step 3: Detach the sprinklers and the junction from the hoses.
Each sprinkler is attached to a hose via a snap connector. Similarly, these hoses are attached to a junction (image below). To detach them, unsnap the hoses by simply pulling back the metal collar and pulling the hose and sprinkler away from each other (see image at right). Do not attempt to unscrew or twist the hoses. If the connection does not unsnap easily, seek assistance.

Step 4: Store the sprinklers and junction on top of the skiff
Once you have successfully detached the sprinklers from the hose, place them together on the upside-down skiff (the flat-bottomed boat), located on the dock between the second and third bays (see image at far right).

Step 5: Leave the remaining segments of hose on the dock
Do not remove the hoses or attempt to gather and store them elsewhere. Simply leave them in the vicinity where they were originally located (see first image below). If the hose junction is in the way or causing a tripping hazard, simply move it out of the way. One such location is at the edge of the main dock near the Cambridge side of the Cambridge dock (see last image below).

### CLEANING AND REPAIRING EQUIPMENT
After practice, oars and boats are returned to their racks and cleaned. The coxswain will direct the members of the crew on specific responsibilities. These typically include:
Wiping down the boat: Towels and spray bottles are located between the second and third bays, just inside the doors to the dock. Use the the clean towels in the grey barrels and place dirty towels in the yellow hampers. 
Storing away the oars: As discussed above, sets of oars should be returned together in the same bay. On occasion, oar handles will become soiled (e.g. from bloody blisters). To clean the oar handle, use the cylindrical stand used for this purpose located near the skiffs on the dock, between the second and third bays (see image at right).
Once a week, usually Fridays, the boats are given a more intensive cleaning. This is done by placing the boat guts-up (seats facing up) on slings on the dock and carefully cleaning the seats, slides (tracks), and deck of the shell before turning it over and giving the hull a soapy bath and hose-down.

If you notice that an item needs repair (e.g. damaged oar) or that a piece of equipment is not in optimal shape (e.g. loose foot stretcher) and you're unable fix it yourself, bring this to the attention of your coach and alert MITRC's equipment manager. Depending on the severity of the issue, the club may seek assistance from the boathouse's boatman.
